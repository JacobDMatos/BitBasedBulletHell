# Bit-Based Bullet Hell
Bit-Based Bullet Hell is a casual game made in Unity. Players must collect as many green tokens as possible whilst avoiding the gradually increasing number of lethal red squares. This is the first game I made in college which allowed for complete creative freedom.

# My contributions to the project:
- Scripted for player movement via applying velocity whenever a movement key is pressed
- Scripted for enemy movement via applying velocity in the direction of a vector reflected off of the contacted wall
- Programmed the timer UI to update and format itself to a timer format
- Implemented the score counter which increments every time a green token is collected
- Designed the system for spawning more enemies after a certain amount of time has passed
